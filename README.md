# Shanghai-Network

"Id" served as an enumeration for each relationship within the network. "Source" indicated the author signing each text, while "target" represented the names of Argentinian writers extracted using the Python function. The "type" field classified relationships as either "directed" or "undirected." The "relations" column described the specific nature of the connection between nodes, drawing from the type of text or textual reference found in the corpus.  The "weight" attribute assigned a value to each relationship: higher weights were assigned to inter-textual interactions like comments (C=2.5) and mentions (M=1.5), while social encounters (Enc=0.3) and participation in the same issue of Babel. Revista de Libros (B=0.25) held lower significance. Finally, the "year" column encompassed the date of the relationship or, in the case of the magazine network dataset, the issue number (1-22) in which the interactions occurred.
The fundamental dataset was formed by the "source" and "target" columns, while attributes like "relations," "type," "weight," and "year" provided additional context. The research data has been divided into four tables to represent the network's evolution over the years, accounting for fluctuations in the number of members and metrics such as density, centrality, and centralization specific to each period. As the primary focus was on investigating diachronic changes within the network, the tables indicating the years of exchanges offer a comprehensive view of the principal structural and metric changes over time.
